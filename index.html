    <p>I am now a student at Code Fellows. After high school, I went to college, which turned out not to be a good fit for me. I did earn my associates in science for physics, and went back to WSU to get close to finishing my physics degreee. My job to pay my way through school was at Pizza Hut. After I was done with school, Pizza Hut offered me a promotion so I quit and started at code fellows. I was not willing to dedicate the rest of my life to that company.
